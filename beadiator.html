      <p>Name: Kim Jackson
        <br /><br />
        Not much to tell about me. I've been a nerd since the womb. Predisposed to it, in fact. My father was in one of the first A/V (Audio and Visual) clubs 
        in his high school and then went into the military for television engineering. He retired when I was pretty young and 
        I was constantly conscripted to help with building of things or setting up of electronics. So I got my nerdiness from him.
        <br /><br />
        The shop that he had onboard ship had an NES that they played Tetris on, sometimes one-handed 
        with one of those huge controllers with a joystick. We continued to buy the video game consoles because my sister - who was around 
        5 when they came out in the US - loved the games. By the time I was old enough to really enjoy games, it had evolved into the 
        SNES era. Which, I believe, is one of the best eras of video gaming.
        <br /><br />
        But my parents weren't really into video games, and while my Dad is into technology, my mother has always been more creative. She grew up 
        in a bit of a socialite family who constantly threw parties and things. My mother was in Drama and Choir in high school and church before 
        she got married to my father, and ever since has enjoyed Liberal Arts and writing and other creatively inspired things.
        <br /><br />
        I believe it is a combination of my parents that lead me down this nerdily creative path. But my friend from high school was the one that got me 
        into beading. I don't know how she got started on it, but I thought it was creative work I could do with my hands, which was something I 
        loved doing. Writing doesn't generate the same results as creating a piece of jewelry or a keychain or something does. Writing is something that, especially 
        in this day and age when there's so much TLDR going around, is fairly thankless.
        <br /><br />
        So that's how I got into beading. Tell us your stories on the Forums.
